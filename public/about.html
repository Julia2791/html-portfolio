<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Italian but currently living in Belgium, working as a multilanguage customer support operator.
  I can speak fluently 4 languages (Italian, English, French and Spanish) and I am also learning Dutch and German.
</p>

<p>I started to feel intrigued about Web Development during the Covid period, so in April 2021 I subscribed for an online 4-week workshop which permitted me to create my first simple web page.
  You can have a look <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/cohorts/shecodes-online-workshop-63-0/projects/336882">here</a>.
</p>

<p>I really look forward to seeing where this amazing journey will take me.</p>
